# PirateProblemCS370
<!-- 

In this project, I was given starter code for a treasure hunt game implemented using deep Q-learning. The provided code included classes for representing the environment (TreasureMaze) and storing game experiences (GameExperience). Additionally, helper functions for visualization and game simulation were provided.

The main task was to complete the deep Q-learning implementation, which involved training a neural network to find the optimal path for a pirate to reach the treasure in the maze. This involved implementing the Q-learning algorithm, which includes exploration and exploitation strategies.

Here's a breakdown of the work I did on this project:

Reviewed the provided code and understood its components, including the maze environment, game experience storage, and helper functions.
Implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm by completing the provided code blocks marked with #TODO. This involved:
Building a neural network model using Keras.
Implementing the Q-learning training algorithm, which includes exploration, experience replay, and updating the Q-values based on rewards.
Tested the model using provided functions to check if it passes the completion check and to simulate a game to see if the pirate can find the treasure.
Connect Learning to Computer Science:

Computer scientists engage in a wide range of activities, from designing algorithms and building software systems to analyzing complex problems and developing solutions. This project exemplifies several aspects of computer science:

Problem-solving: As computer scientists, we approach problems systematically, breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. In this project, we tackled the challenge of optimizing the pathfinding process for a pirate navigating a maze to find treasure.

Algorithm design and implementation: Deep Q-learning is a powerful algorithm used in reinforcement learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence. Implementing and fine-tuning this algorithm required understanding its principles and adapting them to the specific problem domain.

Software development: Writing clean, efficient code is a fundamental skill in computer science. Throughout this project, we leveraged Python and libraries like Keras to build the treasure hunt game and the deep Q-learning model.

Testing and evaluation: Rigorous testing and evaluation are essential in computer science to ensure the correctness and effectiveness of algorithms and software systems. We tested our model using various metrics, including win rate and completion check.

Ethical Considerations:

As computer scientists, we have ethical responsibilities to both end users and organizations:

User privacy and safety: When developing software systems, we must prioritize user privacy and safety. This includes handling sensitive data appropriately and ensuring that systems are secure against potential threats.

Fairness and transparency: Algorithms, including those used in machine learning, can have significant impacts on individuals and society. It's crucial to design algorithms that are fair and transparent, avoiding biases and ensuring accountability.

Ethical use of technology: Computer scientists should consider the potential societal impacts of their work and strive to use technology for the greater good. This involves ethical decision-making and being mindful of the consequences of technological advancements.
